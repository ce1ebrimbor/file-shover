# File Shover

Painfully naive implementation of a static web server in Rust. Built for learning and experimentation.

**How to run:**
```
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- --root test-sites/simple-portfolio -p 7878
```

## Architecture

### Current Design

- **FileTree**: Provides streaming file access via `get_reader()` - returns `BufReader<File>` for memory-efficient file reading
- **HTTP Message Handling**: Request parsing and response generation with convenience methods for`common HTTP operations
- **Response System**: Currently stores entire response body in memory as `String` or `Vec<u8>`

### Known Limitations

#### ðŸš§ Streaming Response Mismatch

- **FileTree** is designed for streaming: `get_reader()` returns a reader for memory-efficient file access

## Future Improvements

### Phase 1: Core Streaming
- [x] **Add Multi-threading**
- [ ] **Keep connection alive ?**
- [x] Implement streaming response bodies
- [x] Add binary file support

### Phase 2: Performance
- [x] Add Content-Length header calculation
- [ ] Implement chunked transfer encoding
- [ ] Add compression support (gzip, brotli)

### Phase 3: Features
- [ ] HTTP caching headers (ETag, Last-Modified)
- [ ] Range requests for partial content
- [ ] MIME type detection
    - Basic MimeType
- [ ] Directory listing
- [ ] Graceful shutdown

## Development Notes

- Current focus is on getting basic HTTP functionality working
- Streaming optimizations are deliberately deferred to avoid premature optimization
